# Factorial in 10 Programming Languages

This repository contains implementations of the factorial function in 10 different programming languages. The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). It is denoted by \( n! \) and defined as:

\[ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 1 \]
\[ 0! = 1 \]
